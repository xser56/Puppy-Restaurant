Review: This site looks great, and it mostly matches the figma! The only thing would be getting the title containers on menu, catering, and photos pages does not line up with the ends of the navbar, for responsiveness the card body on the home page should line up with the ends of the image and the footer seems a bit squished with the width of the card above. For tablet and mobile the image for the first card on the About page should have its width line up with the width of the card body. On the catering page for tablet the image of the first card is very stretched. On tablet, down at where the 3 food images rest just above the footer on catering, the one in the middle is smaller than the other two, The same 3 images on mobile are too small. On mobile for the Photos page, the footer is squished to the width of the images above.
